# [Population and Demography Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/benitoitelewuver/population-and-demography-datasets)

## Overview
This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global population and demography data using R. It aims to provide insights into population trends, country-wise comparisons, and demographic patterns from 1950 to 2023. The analysis explores population distributions, growth trends, and identifies top and bottom countries by population size.

## Goals
- Analyze global population trends over time
- Identify and visualize the most and least populous countries
- Explore population growth patterns for selected countries
- Provide insights into demographic shifts and patterns

## Tasks and Deliverables
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Statistical summaries of population data
4. Visualization of population trends and distributions
5. Comparative analysis of countries' population sizes
6. Report generation with key findings and insights

## Tools and Libraries
- R programming language
- RStudio (recommended IDE)
- Key R packages:
  - tidyverse (for data manipulation and visualization)
  - dplyr (for data manipulation)
  - ggplot2 (for creating visualizations)
  - readr (for reading CSV files)
  - summarytools (for summary statistics)

## Analysis
The analysis pipeline includes:
1. Data loading and initial inspection
2. Data cleaning (handling missing values, checking for duplicates)
3. Data transformation (renaming columns, type conversions)
4. Descriptive statistics generation
5. Time-series analysis of population trends
6. Comparative analysis of countries' populations
7. Visualization of key findings

## Reports
The project generates the following reports and visualizations:
1. Summary statistics of the dataset
2. Histogram of data distribution by year
3. Bar chart of top 10 countries by population
4. Bar chart of bottom 10 countries by population
5. Line graph of population growth trends for selected countries

## Findings
Key insights from the analysis include:
1. The dataset covers population data from 1950 to 2023.
2. There is a wide range in population sizes, from 501 to 8,092,000,000.
3. The median population size in the dataset is 3,886,000.
